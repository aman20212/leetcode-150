<pre style="color: blue">
    <code>
        Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
        Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
        Explanation:
        rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
        rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
        rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
        Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
        Explanation: 
        rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
        rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

        Approach Explanation:

        Understanding Rotation:
        -----------------------

        When you rotate the array to the right by k steps, the last k elements of the array will move to the front, and the rest will shift to the right.
        Example:
        Before rotation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Rotate by 2 steps: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

        Efficient Solution:
        -----------------------

        Instead of moving elements one by one, we can break the task into two parts:
        Extract the last k elements.
        Extract the remaining elements (the first n - k elements).
        Concatenate the last k elements with the remaining elements.

        Handling Large k:
        -----------------------

        If k is larger than the array's length, rotating by k steps is the same as rotating by k % nums.length. This reduces unnecessary rotations.

        Time Complexity:
        -----------------
        O(n): Each reversal operation takes linear time, so the total time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.


        Space Complexity:
        ------------------
        O(1): This solution works in-place, so no extra space is required beyond the input array.

        Why k % nums.length Works
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        When you are asked to rotate an array to the right by k steps, you're essentially shifting each element k positions to the right. However, if k is larger than the array's length (nums.length), rotating the array k times is equivalent to rotating the array k % nums.length times.

        Why does this happen?
        Think of an array of length n. When you rotate it by n steps, you're essentially rotating it by the exact number of positions that the array's length is. But after n rotations, the array returns to its original configuration. This is because the elements of the array have all shifted back to where they started.

        For example:

        If you rotate an array of length 5 (say [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) by 5 steps, the array returns to the same order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
        If you rotate it by 10 steps, this is the same as rotating it by 10 % 5 = 0 steps (no rotation), because after every 5 steps, you are back at the start.
        Thus, rotating by a multiple of the array’s length has no effect.


        More Examples:
        --------------
        Example 1: k is larger than nums.length
        Let’s say we have:

        
        let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        let k = 7;

        The length of the array is nums.length = 5.
        Rotating by k = 7 steps is equivalent to rotating by k % 5 = 7 % 5 = 2 steps.
        Why? Because:

        After 5 steps, you will have rotated the array once completely and will be back at the starting position.
        The remaining 2 steps (because 7 - 5 = 2) are what matter for the final result.
        So, rotating [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] by 7 steps is the same as rotating it by 2 steps:

        nums.slice(-2) → [4, 5]
        nums.slice(0, 3) → [1, 2, 3]
        Concatenate them → [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Example 2: Another case where k is larger than nums.length
        Let’s take an array with 3 elements:

        
        let nums = [10, 20, 30];
        let k = 8;
        The length of the array is nums.length = 3.
        Rotating by k = 8 steps is equivalent to rotating by k % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2 steps.
        So, rotating [10, 20, 30] by 8 steps is the same as rotating by 2 steps:

        nums.slice(-2) → [20, 30]
        nums.slice(0, 1) → [10]
        Concatenate them → [20, 30, 10]

<h3>Another Approach</h3>

    <code>
        Reverse-Based Approach
        ----------------------
        The idea is to reverse parts of the array to achieve the rotation:

        Reverse the entire array.
        Reverse the first k elements.
        Reverse the remaining elements (i.e., the elements from index k to the end).


        Steps:
        -------
        Reverse the entire array to move the last k elements to the front.
        Reverse the first k elements to restore their original order.
        Reverse the rest of the array (from k to the end) to restore their original order.


        This solution works in-place and doesn't require extra space for a new array.

        var rotate = function(nums, k) {
            // Handle edge case where k is greater than the length of the array
            k = k % nums.length;
            
            // Reverse the entire array
            reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
            
            // Reverse the first k elements
            reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
            
            // Reverse the remaining elements
            reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
        };
        
        // Helper function to reverse a part of the array
        function reverse(nums, start, end) {
            while (start < end) {
                // Swap elements at start and end
                let temp = nums[start];
                nums[start] = nums[end];
                nums[end] = temp;
                
                start++;
                end--;
            }
        }
        
        // Example 1:
        let nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
        let k1 = 3;
        rotate(nums1, k1);
        console.log(nums1);  // Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        
        // Example 2:
        let nums2 = [-1, -100, 3, 99];
        let k2 = 2;
        rotate(nums2, k2);
        console.log(nums2);  // Output: [3, 99, -1, -100]
