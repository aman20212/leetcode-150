<h2>Container With Most Water</h2>

<pre>
    <code>
        You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

        Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

        Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

        Notice that you may not slant the container.

        

        Example 1:


        Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        Output: 49
        Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
        Example 2:

        Input: height = [1,1]
        Output: 1

        Approach
        Simply, we calculate max area of rectangle then return it. Formula is

        width * height
        Let's think about width and height with this example.

        Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        Each number is height, so we can easily get height. But how about width?

        width is also simple. It's just distance between two heights. That's why it's good idea to have two pointers left and right.

        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        L               R

        Left pointer starts from index 0
        Right pointer starts from the last index
        Let's see how it works!

        width = right - left = 8 - 0 = 8
        For height, we take smaller height between left and right, because if we calculate based on the taller height, the water would overflow from the container.

        height = min(height[left], height[right]) = min(1, 7) = 1
        Current max area should be

        8 * 1 = 8
        After that, we want to move one of the pointers. How can we judge it? It's simple. We want to keep taller height between left and right because there is a possibility that we will get max area with the taller height.

        In this case,

        left vs right = 1 vs 7
        So we move the left pointer to next.

        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        L             R

        max_area = 8
        We will repeat the same process until we break left < right condition. I'll speed up.

        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        L             R

        max_area = 8
        current_area = 7 * 7 = 49
        max_area = max(8, 49) = 49
        Move R to next
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        L           R

        max_area = 49
        current_area = 6 * 3 = 18
        max_area = max(49, 18) = 49
        Move R to next
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        L         R

        max_area = 49
        current_area = 5 * 8 = 40
        max_area = max(49, 40) = 49
        Move L to next 
        In the above case, we can also move R instead of L because L and Rare the same(= 8).

        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
            L       R

        max_area = 49
        current_area = 4 * 6 = 14
        max_area = max(49, 24) = 49
        Move L to next 
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
            L     R

        max_area = 49
        current_area = 3 * 2 = 6
        max_area = max(49, 6) = 49
        Move L to next 
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
                L   R

        max_area = 49
        current_area = 2 * 5 = 10
        max_area = max(49, 10) = 49
        Move L to next 
        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
                L R

        max_area = 49
        current_area = 1 * 4 = 4
        max_area = max(49, 4) = 49
        Move L to next 
        Now L and R are the same index. We shop iteration.

        0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (= index)
        [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
                    L
                    R 
        return 49

    <code style="color: blue; font-weight: 700;">
        var maxArea = function(height) {
            let maxArea = 0;
            let left = 0;
            let right = height.length - 1;
        
            while (left < right) {
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]));
        
                if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                    left++;
                } else {
                    right--;
                }
            }
        
            return maxArea;    
        };
