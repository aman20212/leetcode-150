    <code>
        Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

        Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
        Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
        Explanation: 
        nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
        nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
        nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
        The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
        Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,1,1]
        Output: []
        Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
        Example 3:

        Input: nums = [0,0,0]
        Output: [[0,0,0]]
        Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

        I think it's tough to manage 3 indices at the same time, so my strategy is to fix i.

        Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
        [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
        i
        We fix i at index 0 at first. Then we have other two indices j and k. j starts from i + 1 and k starts from the last index.

        [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
        i j         k
        Basically, we calculate a total of 3 numbers, then if the total is 0, that is one of target triplets.

        But there are many cases where the total is not 0. In that case we should move j or k to the next, because we fix i at index 0 at first. All calculations in a loop this time, we must use i number.

        Question

        How can we decide and move j or k to the next index?

        My strategy is to sort input array, so that we can decide which index we should move.

        [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
        ↓
        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
        i  j        k

        Why do we need to sort input array?
        That's because if the total is greater than 0, we want small total next time. In that case, we should move k to the next because input array is sorted, we are sure that if k move to left index, we will get small total compared with the current total.

        On the other hand, if the total is smaller than 0, we want big total next time. In that case we should move j to the right index to get big total.

        Let's see one by one.

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
        i  j        k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = -3
        We should move j to the next.

        I'll speed up

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
        i     j     k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = -3

        j moves to the next

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
        i       j   k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = -2

        j moves to the next

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
        i         j k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = -1

        j moves to the next

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
        i           k
                    j
        Now j and k are the same index, so we stop iteration. For this question, we have to find all triplets.

        Next, we fix i at index 1. j starts from i + 1 and k starts from the last index.

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
            i  j     k
        We do the same thing.

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
            i  j     k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0
        We found total 0 and 3 indices are different, so current combination meets condition the description says. That is one of answers.

        res = [[-1,-1,2]]
        When we found the target triplet, there are several ways to move pointers. I think easiest way is to move j once.

        But there is problem. What if the next number is the same as current number like this.

        [-4,-1,-1,-1,1,2]
            i    j   k

        I changed 0 to -1 at index 3.
        In this case, we found [-1,-1,2] again. It's the target triplet but the description says "No duplicate".

        To avoid this, when we found one of the target triplets, we move j once but we check the number after we move j. If the number is the same previous number, we continue to move j until we find differnt number, so that we can avoid duplicate combination.

        ⭐️ Points

        Move j until we find different number when we find one of the target triplets.

        Let's go back to main topic.

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
            i    j   k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 1
        Now the total is greater than 0. We should move k to the left index to get small total.

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
            i    j k

        nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0
        We found a new triplets that meets the conditions.

        res = [[-1,-1,2], [-1,0,1]]
        This example is example 1 in the description. It says those two combinations are return value, so I stop explanation.

        After that, we do the same thing. j and k are the same index, so we fix i at index 2. j starts from i + 1 and k starts from the last index.

        [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]
                i j   k
        In the end,

        return [[-1,-1,2], [-1,0,1]]

        This question is asking you to find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero. Here's how you can approach it:

        Approach (Optimized - Two Pointers)
        1. Sort the Array: Sorting helps in efficiently finding triplets while avoiding duplicates.
        2. Fix One Element: Iterate through the array and fix one element at a time.
        3. Use Two-Pointer Technique: For each fixed element, use two pointers (left and right) to find the other two elements that sum to zero.
        4. Avoid Duplicates: Skip duplicate numbers to ensure unique triplets.

        Step-by-Step Explanation
        1. Sort the array to make it easier to avoid duplicate triplets.
        2. Loop through the array and fix one element nums[i] at a time.
        3. Use two pointers (left and right) to find pairs that sum to -nums[i]:
        ○ If nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] == 0, add the triplet to the result.
        ○ If the sum is too small, move left forward (left++).
        ○ If the sum is too large, move right backward (right--).
        4. Skip duplicates for both i, left, and right to avoid duplicate triplets.

        Approach
        Let's break down your Java solution for the Three Sum problem step by step.

        Understanding the Goal
        • Given an array nums, find all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] where:
        ○ i != j != k
        ○ nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0
        • The solution must not contain duplicate triplets.

        Code Breakdown
        class Solution {
        public List<List> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        • Defines a Solution class with a method threeSum that:
        ○ Takes an array of integers (nums).
        ○ Returns a list of lists (List<List>), where each inner list represents a unique triplet summing to zero.

        Step 1: Initialize the Result List
        List<List> res = new ArrayList<>();
        • Creates an empty list res to store the valid triplets.

        Step 2: Sort the Array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        • Sorting helps eliminate duplicate triplets efficiently.
        • It also makes it easier to apply the two-pointer technique.

        Step 3: Iterate Over the Array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        • Iterates over each element nums[i] in the array.
        • This element is fixed as the first number in the triplet.

        Step 4: Skip Duplicates for i
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
        continue;
        }
        • Avoids duplicate triplets by skipping repeated elements.
        • If nums[i] is the same as the previous element (nums[i - 1]), we skip this iteration.

        Step 5: Initialize Two Pointers
        int j = i + 1;
        int k = nums.length - 1;
        • Uses two pointers:
        ○ j (left pointer) starts right after i.
        ○ k (right pointer) starts at the last index.

        Step 6: Find Triplets with Two Pointers
        while (j < k) {
        • Runs as long as j and k don’t cross.

        Step 7: Compute the Sum
        int total = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];
        • Adds up the three numbers: nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k].

        Step 8: Move Pointers Based on Sum
        if (total > 0) {
        k--;
        } else if (total < 0) {
        j++;
        }
        • If total > 0, the sum is too large, so move k left (decreasing the sum).
        • If total < 0, the sum is too small, so move j right (increasing the sum).

        Step 9: Store Valid Triplet
        else {
        res.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]));
        j++;
        • If total == 0, we found a valid triplet!
        • Store it in res using Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]).
        • Move j forward to look for more pairs.

        Step 10: Skip Duplicate Values for j
        while (nums[j] == nums[j - 1] && j < k) {
        j++;
        }
        • Avoids duplicate triplets by skipping consecutive duplicate values for nums[j].

        Step 11: Return the Result
        return res;
        • Returns the list of unique triplets.

        Example Walkthrough
        Input:
        nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
        Sorted Array:
        [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]
        Iterations:
        i = 0 (-4)
        • j = 1 (-1), k = 5 (2)
        ○ total = -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3 (increase j)
        • j = 2 (-1), k = 5 (2)
        ○ total = -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3 (increase j)
        • j = 3 (0), k = 5 (2)
        ○ total = -4 + 0 + 2 = -2 (increase j)
        • j = 4 (1), k = 5 (2)
        ○ total = -4 + 1 + 2 = -1 (increase j)
        i = 1 (-1)
        • j = 2 (-1), k = 5 (2)
        ○ total = -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 (store [-1, -1, 2])
        • j = 3 (0), k = 4 (1)
        ○ total = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0 (store [-1, 0, 1])
        i = 2 (-1)
        • Skipped (duplicate)
        Final Output:
        [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
