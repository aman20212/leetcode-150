        Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

        Symbol       Value
        ------       ------
        I             1
        V             5
        X             10
        L             50
        C             100
        D             500
        M             1000

        For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

        Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

        I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
        X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
        C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
        Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "III"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: III = 3.
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "LVIII"
        Output: 58
        Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
        Example 3:

        Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
        Output: 1994
        Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

<h3>Solution With Example</h3>
<pre>
    <code style="font-weight: 600; color: red;">
        var romanToInt = function(s) {
            const mp = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000};
            let ans = 0;
            for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
                if (mp[s[i]] < mp[s[i+1]]) {
                  ans-= mp[s[i]]
              } else {
                  ans += mp[s[i]];
              }
            }
            return ans;
        };

        Approach
        --------
        The description includes the example of 27. If the values are written from left to right in descending order, simply adding each number one by one will give the result.

        XXVII
        ↓
        10(X) + 10(X) + 5(V) + 1(I) + 1(I) = 27
        LVIII
        ↓
        50(L) + 5(V) + 1(I) + 1(I) + 1(I) = 58
        But numbers like 4 and 9 are represented as a single number using two Roman numerals.

        IV = 4
        IX = 9
        ⭐️ Points

        Basically, you just need to convert either one or two characters into a number to get the answer.

        How do we determine if it’s one or two characters?
        Since a single number can use up to two Roman characters, we loop through the string two characters at a time, shifting by one each time.

        Let’s take a look at this example.

        Input: s = "XIV"
        In the first loop, we use X and I. In this case, the second character I is less than X. I is 1 and X is 10. That means we can simply add X to result variable, because 10 → 1 is a descending order. It's the same as 27 or 58 above.

        res = 10
        Next, we use I and V. In this case, the second character V is greater than I, because V is 5 and I is 1.

        The description says "there are six instances where subtraction is used."

        IV = 4
        IX = 9
        XL = 40
        XC = 90
        CD = 400
        CM = 900
        Look at all the first characters and the second characters. The first characters are less than the second characters.

        I(1) + V(5) = 4
        I(1) + X(10) = 9
        X(10) + L(50) = 40
        X(10) + C(100) = 90
        C(100) + D(500) = 400
        C(100) + M(1000) = 900
        The current first character is I and the second character is V, so we are using two Roman characters to form a single number.

        In this case, we subtract I(= 1) from result variable, because in the next loop, we will add V(= 5), so the total of I and V will be 4 in the end.

        res = 9
        The next two number is V and nothing(= out of bounds), so we stop iteration.

        The last point is that as I told you, we should add V before return the answer, because one of values was out of bounds, that's why we couldn't add the last Roman chartacter which is V.

        return res + 5
        Before we start looping, we have HashMap to combine Roman and Integer, so that we can convert Roman to Integer easily.

        Time complexity: O(n)
        n is the length of the input string.

        Space complexity: O(1)
        The dictionary roman always has a fixed size of seven key-value pairs, regardless of the input size, so it uses constant space.
