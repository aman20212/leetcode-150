<h2>Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</h2>
<pre>
    <code style="font-weight: 400; color: red;">
        For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

        Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
        Output: "ABC"
        Example 2:

        Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
        Output: "AB"
        Example 3:

        Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
        Output: ""

        What is GCD?
        ------------
        The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

        For example:

        The GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, because 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 evenly.

        12 ÷ 6 = 2

        18 ÷ 6 = 3

        How to find the GCD of two numbers?
        There are several ways to compute the GCD, but two common methods are:

        1. Using Division (Euclidean Algorithm)
        This is the most efficient way to compute the GCD. The idea is:

        If you repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller number and replace the larger number with the remainder, the process will eventually lead to the GCD.

        Steps:
        ------

        Divide the larger number by the smaller number.

        Replace the larger number with the remainder.

        Repeat until the remainder is 0. When the remainder becomes 0, the smaller number is the GCD.

        Example: Find the GCD of 48 and 18 using the Euclidean algorithm:
        Divide 48 by 18:

        48 ÷ 18 = 2 (remainder 12)

        Now, divide 18 by the remainder (12):

        18 ÷ 12 = 1 (remainder 6)

        Now, divide 12 by the remainder (6):

        12 ÷ 6 = 2 (remainder 0)

        Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is 6.

        Time Complexity:
        ---------------
        Concatenation (str1 + str2 and str2 + str1):

        O(n + m)

        Concatenating two strings of length n and m takes time proportional to the sum of their lengths (n + m).

        Comparison of concatenated strings (str1 + str2 !== str2 + str1):

        O(n + m)

        Comparing two strings of length n + m also takes time proportional to their length.

        Euclidean Algorithm (for GCD of lengths of str1 and str2):

        O(log(min(n, m)))

        The Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD of two numbers (n and m) works in log(min(n, m)) time. This is an efficient logarithmic operation.

        Substring Extraction (str1.substring(0, len)):

        O(len), where len = gcd(n, m)

        Extracting a substring of length len from str1 takes O(len) time. In the worst case, len is min(n, m).

        Total Time Complexity:
        ------------------------
        O(n + m + log(min(n, m)))

        Why?:

        The dominant costs are string concatenation and comparison (O(n + m)), with a smaller cost from the Euclidean algorithm (O(log(min(n, m)))). 
        The substring operation adds a small cost relative to the lengths involved (O(len)).

        Space Complexity:
        ----------------
        String Concatenation (str1 + str2 and str2 + str1):

        O(n + m)

        The space required to store the concatenated strings is proportional to the total length of str1 and str2.

        Euclidean Algorithm:
        --------------------

        O(1)

        The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store variables (a, b, and temp).

        Substring Extraction:

        O(1) (in most cases)

        Substring extraction generally does not use additional space, as it works with a view into the original string. However, if a new string object is created, it could potentially take up space proportional to the substring's length.

        Total Space Complexity:
        -----------------------
        O(n + m)
        Why?:

        The primary space cost comes from the string concatenation (O(n + m)), as this creates new strings that need to be stored temporarily. The space used by the Euclidean algorithm is constant, and the substring extraction is either constant or negligible.

        Final Summary:
        --------------
        Time Complexity: O(n + m + log(min(n, m)))

        Dominated by string concatenation and comparison (O(n + m)), with the Euclidean algorithm (O(log(min(n, m)))) and substring extraction adding smaller costs.

        Space Complexity: O(n + m)

        Primarily driven by the space required to store the concatenated strings (str1 + str2 and str2 + str1).
