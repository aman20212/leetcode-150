<h2>Merge Strings Alternatively</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
        If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

        Return the merged string.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
        Output: "apbqcr"
        Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
        word1:  a   b   c
        word2:    p   q   r
        merged: a p b q c r
