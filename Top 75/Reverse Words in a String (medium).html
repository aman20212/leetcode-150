<h2>Reverse Words in a String</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

        A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

        Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

        Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "the sky is blue"
        Output: "blue is sky the"
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "  hello world  "
        Output: "world hello"
        Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
        Example 3:

        Input: s = "a good   example"
        Output: "example good a"
        Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

        ----------


        var reverseWords = function(s) {
            let words = s.split(' ');
            let res = [];
        
            for (let i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (words[i]) {
                    res.push(words[i]);
                }
            }
        
            return res.join(' ');
