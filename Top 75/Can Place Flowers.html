<h2>Can Place Flowers</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

        Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
        Output: true


        Example 2:

        Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
        Output: false

        var canPlaceFlowers = function(flowerbed, n) {

            for (let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
                if (
                    flowerbed[i] === 0 &&                              // Current plot is empty
                    (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0) &&             // Left plot is empty or we're at the start
                    (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0) // Right plot is empty or we're at the end

                    flowerbed[i] = 1; // Plant a flower
                    count++;          // Increase our flower count
        
                    if (count >= n) return true; // Early return if we‚Äôve planted enough
                }
            }
        
            return count >= n; // Final check if loop ends without early return
        };

    ------------------------------
    <code>
        Key Logic:
        1. Check if the current plot is empty:

        flowerbed[i] === 0


        2. Check if left neighbor is empty:

        (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0)
        i === 0 is needed because there's no left neighbor at the beginning of the array.

        3. Check if right neighbor is empty:

        (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0)
        i === flowerbed.length - 1 handles the last plot, which has no right neighbor.

        4. If all three are empty, it's safe to plant:

        flowerbed[i] = 1;
        count++;


        We simulate planting by setting flowerbed[i] = 1, so we don‚Äôt accidentally try to plant right next to it later.

        if (count >= n) return true;
        As soon as we‚Äôve planted enough flowers, we stop early to save time.

        üß± Visual Representation:
        Imagine this flowerbed:

        Index:        0   1   2   3   4
        flowerbed:    1   0   0   0   1


        Let's check each index.

        At i = 2:
        flowerbed[2] === 0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ empty

        flowerbed[1] === 0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ left is empty

        flowerbed[3] === 0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ right is empty
        ‚Üí ‚úÖ You can plant here

        ‚úÖ Condition Explained:
        
        flowerbed[i] === 0 &&
        ‚û°Ô∏è Is the current spot empty?

        (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0) &&
        ‚û°Ô∏è Is the left spot empty, or are we at the very start (no left neighbor)?

        (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0)
        ‚û°Ô∏è Is the right spot empty, or are we at the very end (no right neighbor)?
