<h2>Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</h2>
<pre>
    <code style="color: red; font-weight: 400;">
        Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

        Example 1:

        Input: s = "abcabcbb"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "bbbbb"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
        Example 3:

        Input: s = "pwwkew"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
        Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

        Solution 1 - Sliding Window & Set
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        First of all, we create

        left = 0 
        max_length = 0 (returned value)
        char_set = set() 
        left is pointer of sliding window.
        max_length is a value we should return.
        char_set is to keep current characters forming the longest string with the two conditions above.

        We will iterate through all characters one by one and create right pointer of sliding window with for loop.

        for right in range(len(s)):
        Let's begin!

        Input: s = "abcabcbb"
        "abcabcbb"
        r
        l

        l is left of sliding window
        r is right of sliding window
        We found a. Every time we check char_set if we have the same character or not. In this case, we don't have a in char_set, so add a to char_set.

        char_set = {a}
        After that, we check max length.

        max_length = 0
        current length = right - left + 1
        Why +1?
        That's because current length of string is 1 which is only a, so if we don't add 1, we will calculate 0(right) - 0(left) = 0 which is wrong answer.

        This happens because index number usually starts from 0 but actual count we do in daily life starts 1. That's why we need to kind of convert an index number to a real number by adding +1.

        Let's go back to the main point.

        max_length = 1
        Next, only right pointer move next. I'll speed up.

        "abcabcbb"
        lr

        Do we have "b"? → No
        char_set = {a, b}

        max_length = 2 (right(1) - left(0) + 1)
        Next, only right pointer move next.

        "abcabcbb"
        l r

        Do we have "c"? → No
        char_set = {a,b,c}

        max_length = 3 (right(2) - left(0) + 1)
        Next, only right pointer move next.

        "abcabcbb"
        l  r

        Do we have "a"? → Yes
        In this case, we have duplicate number a, so we can't continue to expand the string. That's why it's time to move left to the next. And we have important point.

        ⭐️ Points

        When we move left to index 1, a at index 0 will be out of bounds, so we should remove a from char_set, so that we can keep unique characters forming the current string.

        In this case, we use while loop, I'll explain why later.

        "abcabcbb"
        l  r

        - Do we have "a"? → Yes, remove "a" in char_set
        char_set = {b,c}

        - move left to the next
        "abcabcbb"
        l r

        - There is no "a" in char_set, we stop while looping.
        - And add crreunt "a" to char_set
        char_set = {b,c,a}

        max_length = 3 (right(3) - left(1) + 1)
        Next, only right pointer move next.

        "abcabcbb"
        l  r

        - Do we have "b"? → Yes, remove "b" in char_set
        char_set = {c,a}

        - move left to the next
        "abcabcbb"
        l r

        - There is no "b" in char_set, we stop while looping.
        - And add crreunt "b" to char_set
        char_set = {c,a,b}

        max_length = 3 (right(4) - left(2) + 1)
        Next, only right pointer move next.

        "abcabcbb"
        l  r

        - Do we have "c"? → Yes, remove "c" in char_set
        char_set = {a,b}

        - move left to the next
        "abcabcbb"
            l r

        - There is no "c" in char_set, we stop while looping.
        - And add crreunt "c" to char_set
        char_set = {a,b,c}

        max_length = 3 (right(5) - left(3) + 1)
        Next, only right pointer move next.

        "abcabcbb"
            l  r

        - Do we have "b"? → Yes, remove "a" in char_set
        Wait! Why do we have to remove a instead of b? That's because b is now duplicate character between left and right, so we have to remove chracters until we find b with left pointer.

        ⭐️ Points
        Let's look at the string deeply.

        "abcb"
        l  r
        If we keep a in the string, we have to also keep the first b because a is outside of the first b in the string. If we want to remove the first b, we must remove a before we remove the first b. This is substring.

        In the end,

        "abcb"
        lr
        Let's look at the process.

        "abcabcbb"
            l  r

        - Do we have "b"? → Yes, remove "a" in char_set
        char_set = {b,c}

        - Move left to the next
        "abcabcbb"
            l r

        - Do we have "b"? → Yes, remove "b" in char_set
        char_set = {c}

        - Move left to the next
        "abcabcbb"
            lr

        - Do we have "b"? → No, now we stop while loop

        - Add current "b" to char_set
        - char_set = {c,b}

        max_length = 3 > (right(6) - left(5) + 1)
        I hope now you understand why we use while loop when remove charcters. There is an case where we remove multiple characters.

        I stop rest of explanation because we will repeat the same process.

        return 3
        As you can see, we keep char_set the same as the string between left and right when we add a current character to char_set.
        That's why we can check if current character is duplicate or not.
