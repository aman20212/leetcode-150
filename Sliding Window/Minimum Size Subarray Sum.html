<h2>Minimum Size Subarray Sum</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, 
        return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

 
        Example 1:

        Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
        Example 2:

        Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
        Output: 1
        Example 3:

        Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
        Output: 0

        Approach
        ----------


        Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        We need to find minimum length of subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target, so let's create a left pointer and a right pointer.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        L
        R

        cur_sum = 0
        min_len = inf
        cur_sum is total number of between left and right.
        min_len is current minimum length of subarray which is a return value.

        Basically, we iterate through all numbers one by one with the right pointer and add a right number to cur_sum.

        First of all, we find 2 at index 0.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        L
        R

        cur_sum = 2
        min_len = inf
        Next, check

        cur_sum >= target
        If we meet the condition, it's time to compare current length with min_len.

        But currently

        cur_sum >= target
        = 2 >= 7
        = false
        Just move right to next.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        L R
        
        Add 3 to cur_sum

        cur_sum = 5

        cur_sum >= target
        = 5 >= 7
        = false

        min_len = inf
        ------------------------------------
        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        L   R
        
        Add 1 to cur_sum

        cur_sum = 6

        cur_sum >= target
        = 6 >= 7
        = false

        min_len = inf
        ------------------------------------
        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        L     R
        
        Add 2 to cur_sum

        cur_sum = 8

        cur_sum >= target
        = 8 >= 7
        = true

        min_len = inf
        Now we meet cur_sum >= target. It's time to compare current length with min_len

        current length vs `min_len`
        = right - left + 1 vs inf
        = 4 vs inf
        = 4

        min_len = 4
        Why did we set inf to min_len?
        That's because any number greater than target could be the first answer. 
        If we find only one length, that should be return value, so we need to keep the first length we found.

        cur_sum is greater than target. Before we move next, we should reduce numbers from cur_sum, because 
        if we add some number, length of the current range will expand. That is definitely not answer. That's why we make the current range short.

        Move left to next, but don't forget to subtract 2(= index 0) from cur_sum, because when left pointer moves to index 1, 2(= index 0) 
        should be out of bounds of current range between left and right.

        Subtract 2 from cur_sum

        cur_sum - 2 = 6
        Move next,

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        L     R
        
        Add 4 to cur_sum

        cur_sum = 10

        cur_sum >= target
        = 10 >= 7
        = true

        current length vs `min_len`
        = right - left + 1 vs inf
        = 4 vs 4
        = 4
        cur_sum is 10. Let's shorten the range.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
            L   R

        cur_sum = 7
        min_len = 4

        cur_sum >= target
        = 7 >= 7
        = true
        still 7. we should check length of current array.

        current length vs `min_len`
        = right - left + 1 vs 4
        = 3 vs 4
        = 3

        min_len = 3
        cur_sum = 7

        cur_sum is 7. Let's shorten the range.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
            L R

        cur_sum = 6 < target.
        Move right pointer next.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
            L   R
        
        Add 3 to cur_sum

        cur_sum = 9

        cur_sum >= target
        = 9 >= 7
        = true

        current length vs `min_len`
        = right - left + 1 vs inf
        = 3 vs 3
        = 3
        cur_sum is 9. Let's shorten the range.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
                L R

        cur_sum = 7, still cur_sum >= target is true.

        current length vs `min_len`
        = right - left + 1 vs 3
        = 2 vs 3
        = 2

        min_len = 2
        cur_sum = 7

        cur_sum is 7. Let's shorten the range.

        [2,3,1,2,4,3]
                R
                L

        cur_sum = 3
        Then finish iteration.

        return 2(= min_len)
