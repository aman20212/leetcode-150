<h2>Minimum Window Substring</h2>
<pre>
    <code style="font-weight: 400; color: red;">
        Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

        The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

        

        Example 1:
        ----------

        Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
        Output: "BANC"
        Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.


        Example 2:
        ----------

        Input: s = "a", t = "a"
        Output: "a"
        Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.


        Example 3:
        ----------

        Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
        Output: ""
        Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
        Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<pre>
    <code>
        Algorithm:
        ----------

        Step 1: Initialize variables:

        Two pointers: start and end, both initialized to 0. These will represent the window's left and right boundaries, respectively.
        A character frequency map for t (let's call it target_freq), which will store the count of each character in t.
        A second frequency map (let's call it window_freq) to track the characters within the current window of s.
        A counter variable count to keep track of how many characters from t have been fully matched in the current window.


        Step 2: Populate the frequency map for t:

        For each character in t, increment its corresponding count in target_freq.


        Step 3: Expand the window (Move the end pointer):

        Start traversing s from left to right by moving the end pointer. For each character s[end], increment its frequency in window_freq.
        If the frequency of s[end] in window_freq matches the frequency in target_freq for that character, increment count.


        Step 4: Check for valid windows:

        Once count equals the number of unique characters in t (i.e., the window contains all characters of t), move the start pointer to shrink the window.
        For each valid window, compare its length with the minimum window length found so far. Update the minimum window length and its starting position if a smaller valid window is found.


        Step 5: Shrink the window (Move the start pointer):

        When the window is valid, try to shrink it by moving the start pointer to the right. After each move, update window_freq and check whether the window still contains all characters of t.
        If the window becomes invalid (i.e., missing a required character), stop shrinking and continue expanding by moving the end pointer.


        Step 6: Return the result:

        Once the end pointer reaches the end of s, return the smallest valid window substring found.


        Time Complexity (TC):O(n)
        -------------------------
        Sliding Window Expansion (end pointer):

        The end pointer moves from the start of s to the end of s. Each character in s is processed once, so the time complexity of this is O(m), where m is the length of s.
        Sliding Window Contraction (start pointer):

        The start pointer can also traverse the entire string s, but it only moves when the window contains all characters from t. The start pointer can move at most m times as well, since every character in s is processed once during contraction.
        Therefore, the time complexity of shrinking the window is also O(m).
        Checking and Updating Frequencies (map array):

        Checking whether the current window contains all characters from t requires constant time per operation because we are using an array of fixed size 128 (int[] map = new int[128]) to store the frequency of characters (based on ASCII values).
        Therefore, all operations related to map (checking and updating character frequencies) take O(1) time per operation.
        Total Time Complexity:

        Since both start and end traverse the entire string s and the operations inside the loop are O(1), the overall time complexity is O(m + n), where m is the length of s and n is the length of tbut since n (the length of t) is smaller than or equal to m (the length of s), we can simplify the complexity to O(m), where m is the length of the string s.


        Space Complexity (SC):O(1)
        --------------------------
        Frequency Map (map array):

        The map array has a fixed size of 128 (since it stores the frequency of ASCII characters), regardless of the length of s or t.
        The space complexity for the map array is O(1) (constant space).
        Other Variables:

        A few other integer variables like count, start, end, minStart, and minLen are used, but these take constant space.
        Total Space Complexity:

        The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the characters in t in the map array and count the frequencies. However, since the map array is of constant size (128), it doesnâ€™t depend on the size of s or t. So, the overall space complexity is O(1), or more accurately O(128), which is effectively constant.
