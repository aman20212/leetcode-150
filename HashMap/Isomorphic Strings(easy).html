<h2>Isomorphic Strings</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

        Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

        All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

        

        Example 1:
        -----------

        Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

        Output: true

        Explanation:


        The strings s and t can be made identical by:

        Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
        Mapping 'g' to 'd'.


        Example 2:
        -----------

        Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

        Output: false

        Explanation:

        The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

        Example 3:
        ----------

        Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

        Output: true

        Solution 1 - Two HashMaps
        --------------------------
        Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
        Simply, each character of both strings should be a pair, that means their indices should be the same.

        To keep character and its index, we use two hashMaps.

        char_index_s = {}
        char_index_t = {}
        First of all

        s = "egg", t = "add"
            ↑          ↑

        e and a should be index 0

        char_index_s = {e: 0}
        char_index_t = {a: 0}
        Next compare the indices of e and a. They are the same which is no porblem.

        Move next

        s = "egg", t = "add"
            ↑          ↑

        g and d should be index 1

        char_index_s = {e: 0, g: 1}
        char_index_t = {a: 0, d: 1}
        Compare the indices of g and d. They are the same which is no porblem.

        Move next

        s = "egg", t = "add"
            ↑          ↑

        char_index_s = {e: 0, g: 1}
        char_index_t = {a: 0, d: 1}
        g and d should be index 1, because we already found the characters at index 1. To prove that, we have g and d in HashMaps.

        Compare g and d. They are index 1 which is no problem.

        Now we reach end of strings.

        return True
        Let's see false case. You will understand algorithm deeply. What if the last characters are a and d.

        s = "ega", t = "add"
            ↑          ↑

        char_index_s = {e: 0, g: 1, a: 2}
        char_index_t = {a: 0, d: 1}
        In that case, a is a new character, so add a to HashMap with index 2. We already found d at index 1, so we don't add this time.

        Next, compare indices of a and d.

        a is index 2
        d is index 1
        They are different indices, that means we already use d with other character.

        return False


        Complexity
        -----------
        This is based on Python. Ohter might be different.

        Time complexity: O(n)
        n is length of input string

        Space complexity: O(1)
        s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
