<h2>Jump Game</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

        Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
        Output: true
        Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
        Output: false
        Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

<h3>Solution 1:</h3>
<pre style="color: red; font-weight: bold">
    <code>
        var canJump = function(nums) {
            let i = 1;
            while (i < nums.length - 1) {
                if (i + nums[i] === nums.length - 1) {
                  return true;
              }
              i++;
            }
            return false;
        };
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Solution 2</h3>
<pre>
    <code style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">
        var canJump = function(nums) {
            let idx = 0;
            let max = 0;
            let target = nums.length - 1;
          
            while (idx < nums.length && idx <= max) {  // Stop if we’re stuck or past the array bounds
              max = Math.max(max, idx + nums[idx]);  // Update the farthest we can reach
              
              if (max >= target) {  // If we can reach or exceed the last index
                return true;
              }
              
              idx++;  // Move to the next index
            }
          
            return false;  // If the loop completes and we couldn't reach the target
        };

        Key Refinements:
        ----------------
            Loop Condition Change (while (idx < nums.length && idx <= max)):

            Now, the loop also stops if idx exceeds max, which prevents unnecessary iterations when you're stuck at an index and cannot proceed further.


            Removal of Final return false:

            The function now automatically returns false when it exits the loop (if it couldn't reach the target), which eliminates redundancy.


            Example Walkthrough:
            Example 1: [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
            max = 0
            At idx = 0, max = Math.max(0, 0 + 2) = 2. Now max = 2.
            At idx = 1, max = Math.max(2, 1 + 3) = 4. Now max = 4.
            At idx = 2, max = Math.max(4, 2 + 1) = 4.
            At idx = 3, max = Math.max(4, 3 + 1) = 4.
            At idx = 4, max = Math.max(4, 4 + 4) = 8, which exceeds the target index (4), so the function returns true.


            Example 2: [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
            max = 0
            At idx = 0, max = Math.max(0, 0 + 3) = 3. Now max = 3.
            At idx = 1, max = Math.max(3, 1 + 2) = 3.
            At idx = 2, max = Math.max(3, 2 + 1) = 3.
            At idx = 3, max = Math.max(3, 3 + 0) = 3. We're stuck because max = 3 and idx = 3, but we can't proceed further.
            The loop terminates, and the function returns false.


            Time and Space Complexity:
            Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the nums array. The loop iterates once through the array.
            Space Complexity: O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space (idx, max, target).

        Yes, this is a greedy approach. Let's break down why:

        Greedy Approach Overview:
        A greedy algorithm makes a series of choices by selecting the best option at each step, with the hope that these local optimal choices will lead to a global optimal solution. In the context of the Jump Game problem, the "best" choice at each step is to always choose the farthest index you can reach.

        Why Your Code is Greedy:
        Farthest Reachable Index: At each index i, you're calculating the farthest index you can reach, which is i + nums[i]. This is the greedy decision — you're always looking for the best possible jump from each position. Specifically, you're aiming to maximize the farthest index (max) that can be reached at each step.

        Local Optimality: You're making a decision at each index by comparing the current index i to the farthest index you can reach (max). You keep updating max to be the maximum of the current max and i + nums[i]. This is a local decision to move as far as possible based on the current position.

        Stop Early if You Can Reach the End: If at any point, max >= target (i.e., the last index), you immediately return true. This is another greedy move because you're trying to reach the end as quickly as possible — if you're able to reach the last index (or beyond) at any step, there's no need to continue checking further.

        Avoid Stuck States: You check if you're stuck at a position (where max <= idx and nums[idx] === 0), and if so, you return false. This is a safeguard against making bad local choices, which is typical in greedy algorithms: if you're stuck, no further progress can be made, and the greedy choice would be to stop early.

        Key Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms in Your Code:
        Making the optimal local choice: You're always trying to move as far as possible from each index (max = Math.max(max, idx + nums[idx])).
        No backtracking: Once you've made a choice (i.e., updated max), you don't revisit previous decisions, which is typical in greedy algorithms.
        Early termination: You return true as soon as you can reach the last index, which is a greedy strategy to stop when you've found the best possible solution.
