    <code>
        You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

        Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

        0 <= j <= nums[i] and
        i + j < n
        Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

        

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
        Output: 2

<h3>Solution: Greedy Approach with Optimal Time and Space Complexity</h3>
<pre>
    <code>
        Time Complexity:
        O(n) — We only iterate through the array once, making it a linear time solution.
        
        Space Complexity:
        O(1) — We only use a constant amount of extra space (for variables like jumps, currentEnd, and farthest).

                            break;

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<pre>
    <code>
        Explanation:
            Initialization:

                jumps = 0 — We start with zero jumps.
                currentEnd = 0 — We start at the first index.
                farthest = 0 — We haven't moved, so we can reach index 0.


            Loop through the array (from i = 0 to n - 2):

                At each index i, we calculate the farthest index we can reach from i by doing: farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]).
                If i == currentEnd, it means we’ve reached the end of the current jump range and we need to make a jump to extend the range. So:
                    Increment jumps by 1.
                    Update currentEnd to the farthest index we can reach.
                    If currentEnd has reached or passed the last index (nums.length - 1), we can stop early since we’ve reached the last index.
            Exit the loop once we reach the last index or jump to it directly.
