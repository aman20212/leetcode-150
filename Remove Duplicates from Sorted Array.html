        Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. 
        The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

        Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

        Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially.
        The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        Return k.

        The judge will test your solution with the following code:

        int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
        int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

        int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

        assert k == expectedNums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
        }
        If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,1,2]
        Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
        Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

            let i = 0;  // Pointer for the last unique element
            let j = 1;  // Pointer for the current element to check

                if (nums[i] !== nums[j]) {
                    i++;  // Move i to the next position
                    nums[i] = nums[j];  // Place the unique element at position i
                }
                j++;  // Move j to the next element to check
            }
        
            // Return the number of unique elements (i + 1 because i is 0-based index)
            return i + 1;
        };

    <code style="color: green;">
        Time Complexity: O(n)
        The algorithm only iterates through the array once. Both i and j pointers traverse the array in a linear fashion.
        The loop condition while (j < nums.length) ensures that j visits each element exactly once, and i only moves when a unique element is found. 
        So in total, each element is processed once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.


        Space Complexity: O(1)
        The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space because it modifies the array in-place. 
        Only a few variables (i, j, and a small temporary integer) are used, regardless of the size of the input. 
        No additional data structures (like arrays or hash sets) are used, so the space complexity is O(1).
