<h2>Longest Common Prefix</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

        If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

        

        Example 1:

        Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
        Output: "fl"
        Example 2:

        Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
        Output: ""
        Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

        Optimal Solution Approach:
        --------------------------
        Horizontal scanning: We can start by comparing the prefix of the first string with the second string, 
        then use the result to compare with the third string, and so on.

        Time complexity: This solution works in O(N * M) time, where N is the number of strings in the array 
        and M is the length of the longest string.

        This is because we compare the current prefix with each string until the common prefix is reduced.

        Explanation:
        ------------
        Initial Setup: The first string strs[0] is assumed to be the longest common prefix.

        Iterate through each string: We loop through the strings starting from the second string. For each string:

        If the current string does not start with the prefix, shorten the prefix by one character (using substring()), until a common prefix is found or the prefix becomes an empty string.

        Early termination: If at any point the prefix becomes an empty string, we return an empty string, as no common prefix exists.

        Return the result: Once the loop finishes, the prefix will contain the longest common prefix for all strings in the array.
