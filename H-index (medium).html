<h2>H-index</h2>
<pre>
    <code style="color: red;">
        Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

        According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 
        Example 1:

        Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
        Output: 3
        Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
        Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.


        Example 2:

        Input: citations = [1,3,1]
        Output: 1

        Carefully read an article about H-index (Hirsch index):

        The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author/journal has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
        [4][5] The index is designed to improve upon simpler measures such as the total number of citations or publications.
        The index works best when comparing scholars working in the same field, since citation conventions differ widely among different fields.

        Keep in mind the formula used to calculate the citations

        for (let i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= citations.length - i) {
                return citations.length - i;
            }
        }
