<h2>Remove Element</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

        Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

        Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        Return k.

<h4>Custom Judge:</h4>

    <code>
        The judge will test your solution with the following code:

        int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
        int val = ...; // Value to remove
        int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                                    // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

        int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

        assert k == expectedNums.length;
        sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
        for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
            assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
        }

        If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
        Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
        Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
        Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
        

        Constraints:

        0 <= nums.length <= 100
        0 <= nums[i] <= 50
        0 <= val <= 100

<h3>Solution with Explanation</h3>
<pre style="color: red">
    <code>
        /**
        * @param {number[]} nums
        * @param {number} val
        * @return {number}
        */
        var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
            let k = 0; // Pointer to track where the next non-val element should go
            for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
                if (nums[i] !== val) {
                    nums[k] = nums[i];  // Move the non-val element to the front
                    k++;  // Increment the valid element counter
                }
            }
            return k; // Return the number of elements not equal to val
        };

        Explanation:
            Initialization: We initialize k = 0 to track the position where the next valid (non-val) element should be placed.

            Looping through the array: We loop through the entire array, and for each element that is not equal to val, we place it at the position indicated by k.

            Return k: After finishing the loop, k will contain the count of elements in the array that are not equal to val.

    <code>
        Time Complexity:
        The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array, because we are iterating through the array once.

        Space Complexity:
        The space complexity is O(1) because we are modifying the array in-place without using any extra space.

        Custom Judge Note:
        The solution modifies the array nums in-place and the order of the remaining elements doesn't matter (so long as they don't contain val). 
        The judge will verify the first k elements and ignore the rest of the array, so the implementation meets the problem requirements.
