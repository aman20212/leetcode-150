<h2>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

        You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

        Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

        Example 1:
        ----------

        Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
        Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


        Example 2:
        ----------

        Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

        Solution:

        /**
        * @param {number[]} prices
        * @return {number}
        */
        var maxProfit = function(prices) {
            let left = 0;
            let right = 1;
            let max_profit = 0;
            while (right < prices.length) {
                if (prices[left] < prices[right]) {
                    let profit = prices[right] - prices[left];
                    max_profit = Math.max(max_profit, profit);
                } else {
                    left = right;
                }
                right++;
            }
            return max_profit;
        };

        Explanation

        let use initialize Left and Right pointer to first and second position of array
        Here Left is to buy stock and Right is to sell stock

        Then we initialize our max_profit as 0.

        Now we will start our while loop and we will run till our
        Right pointer less then length of array
        For Example:
        prices=[7,1,5,3,6,4]
        Note:
        prices[left] --> buy stock
        prices[right] --> sell stock
        now we will check price at right and left pointer

        step 1:

        price[left]=7 price[right]=1 profit=-6
        here price[left] is greater than price[right] so we will move left pointer to the right position and increment our right pointer by 1. We always want our left point to be minimum

        step 2:

        price[left]=1 price[right]=5 profit=4
        here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone

        step 3:

        price[left]=1 price[right]=3 profit=2
        here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will check our max_profit previously it

        was 4 now our current profit is 2 so we will check which is maximum and update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone

        step 4:

        price[left]=1 price[right]=6 profit=5
        here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will check our max_profit previously it was 4 now our current profit is 5 so we will check which is maximum and update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone

        step 5:

        price[left]=1 price[right]=4 profit=3
        same logic as above

        Big O :
        
        n--> length of array
        Time Complexity: O(n)
        Space Complexity: O(1)

        Solution 2

        var maxProfit = function(prices) {
            let minPrice = prices[0];  // Initial buy price
            let maxProfit = 0;
        
            for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
                if (prices[i] > minPrice) {
                    maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);  // Calculate profit
                } else {
                    minPrice = prices[i];  // Update minPrice if we find a lower price
                }
            }
        
            return maxProfit;
        };
